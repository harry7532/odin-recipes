This is a basic recipe website project, designed to introduce  the fundamental concepts of HTML. This project focuses on building a simple yet effective recipe website by employing key HTML elements and principles.

Key Concepts Covered:

1. HTML Boilerplate:
Learn the foundational structure of an HTML document, including the essential elements such as <html>, <head>, and <body>. Understand the role of the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and the <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag for defining document type and character encoding.

2. Ordered and Unordered Lists:
Explore the use of HTML lists (<ul> for unordered and <ol> for ordered) to structure content in a clear and organized manner. Discover how to employ <li> tags to represent list items, perfect for presenting ingredients or steps in a recipe.

3. Links:
Master the art of creating hyperlinks (<a> tags) to connect different pages within the website or link to external resources. Enhance user navigation by incorporating anchor tags effectively.

4. Images:
Delve into the incorporation of images (<img> tags) to visually enhance the recipe website. Learn to embed images, set alternative text, and control image dimensions for an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly design.

Project Scope:
This project is deliberately kept basic to provide a gentle introduction to HTML. By the end of this project, it will be a straightforward recipe website, showcasing  newfound skills in creating structured and linked web content.
