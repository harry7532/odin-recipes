    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is basically a vegetarian alternative to the popular meat-based rice biriyani dedicated to vegetarian or non-meat eaters. In other Veg Biriyani most commonly known as Veg Dum Biriyani is made with a combination of vegetables as an alternative to meat variants like chicken or mutton options. The concept of Veg Biriyani was introduced very recently but has gained a lot of popularity among both veg and non-vegetarians. It is mainly due to the combination of authentic flavor, taste, and the range of spices it has to offer.</p>
    <p>There are myriad ways to make this simple and tasty rice-based dish, but the most common way is the Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani Recipe. In this variant, the rice and gravy are cooked separately but then layered and slow-cooked. This style of slow cooking is known as Dum cooking. This also helps to infuse a lot of flavor to the long grain rice from the gravy, yet keeping the integrity of the rice. The other popular ways include mixing rice and gravy together to make moist and flavored rice. This can be either pressure-cooked or pan-cooked.</p>
